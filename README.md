# Autoregressive Forecasting in Stan

This is a replication of Nathaniel Forde's PyMC tutorial on fitting Bayesian autoregressive models and generating forecasts, which can be found [here](https://www.pymc.io/projects/examples/en/latest/time_series/Forecasting_with_structural_timeseries.html). Rather than specifying the models in PyMC, this repository replicates all the models using Stan.
